CHE477 Langevin Project
====

*Clyde Overby*

Overview
======

This is a Langevin dynamics project for CHE477.  Inputs are given as two files: one that includes all of the particles in the format of index, position, potential energy, and force as a function of x, and a second file that includes the temperature, damping coefficient, time step size, and total integration time.

Output file is given as lines containing index, time, position, and velocity.
